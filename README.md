# Processing-ITP-4-Arduino-Sensors


This is a rudimentary model of the iPhone game, Flappy Birds. I originally wanted the pipe  structure to be automated by a motor, but that system had too many complications. Thus the version you see in the video is simply hand-operated. Donâ€™t hit the pipes or the ceiling or your flappy bird will fall.

The green LED indicates that the game is on, while the red LED indicates that the game is over.

To the flappiest of the birds, you will be missed.
