I originally wanted the pipe  structure to be automated by a motor, but that system had too many complications. Thus the version you see in the video is simply hand-operated. Donâ€™t hit the pipes or the ceiling or your flappy bird will fall.\r\n\r\nThe green LED indicates that the game is on, while the red LED indicates that the game is over.\r\n\r\nTo the flappiest of the birds, you will be missed.\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/Li0RaOC3BpM\r\n\r\nLink to original blogpost:\r\nhttps://itp.nyu.edu/classes/icm-dano-spring2014/flappy-bird-remembered/",
